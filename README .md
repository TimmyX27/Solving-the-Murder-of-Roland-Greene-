# Case File: The Murder of Roland Greene  
**Prepared by:** Lead Data Analyst  
**Date:** October 3rd, 2025  
**Case No.:** RG-0625-Vault  

On the evening of June 1st, 2025, Roland Greene, a renowned art collector, was found dead in the Vault Room of his private estate. The estimated time of death was 8:00pm, coinciding with a gunshot heard within the mansion. While 30 guests and associates claimed to have alibis, digital forensics revealed one of them is lying. This report uses SQL analysis of call logs, access logs, and forensic events to reconstruct the timeline, test alibis, and identify the murderer.

## 1. Timeline of Key Events  

At 7:55pm, Roland answered a call from his driver, followed immediately by another from his chef. During that call, at 8:00pm, a gunshot was heard. The forensic record shows he was last seen alive at 7:57pm. Seconds later, security detected motion in the Vault hallway (8:01:15), the feed was cut (8:03pm), and an emergency call went out from the mansion at 8:05:45.  

Access logs show three individuals near the crime scene: Robin Ahmed entered the Vault at 7:56:35, Jamie Bennett at 8:00:55, and Victor Shaw at 8:04:53. These times place each of them in critical windows before or after the murder.

## 2. Suspect Analysis  

### Robin Ahmed  
Robin Ahmed, once the victim’s partner and now his family doctor, claimed he had “left early.” Yet access logs prove otherwise: he was in the Vault Room at 7:56:35, minutes before the gunshot. This places him as the last person with Roland before death, directly contradicting his alibi. His past relationship with the victim suggests possible resentment or unresolved conflict. More importantly, his timing gives him the only true opportunity to fire the fatal shot.  

### Jamie Bennett  
Jamie Bennett, the household cleaner, insisted she was “at home” during the incident. However, the records show she entered the Vault at 8:00:55, just seconds after the shot was fired. Her presence aligns neatly with the motion detected in the hallway at 8:01:15, supporting the theory that she stumbled upon the crime scene rather than caused it. Her false alibi raises suspicion, but her role appears to be that of a witness, not the killer.  

### Victor Shaw  
Victor Shaw, a rival of Roland and his PR manager, told investigators he was “at the hospital.” The evidence says otherwise. At 8:04:53, just after the security feed was cut, Shaw accessed the Vault. His timing suggests not murder, but interference—potentially tampering with the scene or trying to conceal evidence. His rivalry with Roland provides motive, but the timeline excludes him from firing the fatal shot.  

---

Taken together, the forensic timeline, call records, and access logs build a consistent picture. Only Robin Ahmed had the means, motive, and opportunity to murder Roland Greene. His false alibi and presence in the Vault before the gunshot place him at the scene during the critical moment.  

Jamie Bennett emerges not as the killer but as a witness who entered the Vault seconds too late, while Victor Shaw appears complicit in covering up the crime rather than committing it.

## Final Verdict  
**Robin Ahmed killed Roland Greene.**

**Top three suspects are:**  
1. **Robin Ahmed** (killer)  
2. **Victor Shaw** (possible accomplice or evidence manipulator)  
3. **Jamie Bennett** (unreliable witness with false alibi)
